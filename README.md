# GPC-App
A stand-alone app that allows for the extraction of polymer parameters (Mn, Mw, Mz, PDI, etc) and the tracking of degradation kinetics for large Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) data sets 


The goal of this app is to accelerate the analysis of large sets of chromatograms (eg signal vs time plots) extracted from a gel permiation chromatography system, or anyother kind of size exclusion chromatography system where elution time is a funtion of molecular weight.
